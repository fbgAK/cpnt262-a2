This was a really great read and really helped me understand the basics and groundwork on javascript for this assignment along with catching up on class videos.

- note to self while completing this assignment to assist me in the future: to render js to html. Use DOM or inner html

I marked my html with IDs ("primary-string" and "primary number") corresponding to their action.
document.getElementById & innerhtml to modify
